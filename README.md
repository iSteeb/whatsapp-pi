# WhatsApp-Pi

A WhatsApp integration extension for the **[Pi Coding Agent](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent)**. 

Pi is a powerful agentic AI coding assistant that operates in your terminal. This extension allows you to chat and pair-program with your Pi agent directly through WhatsApp, featuring message filtering, allow-listing, and reliable message delivery.

## Features

- **Manual WhatsApp Connection**: QR code-based authentication with session persistence
- **Allow List**: Control which numbers can interact with Pi
  - Add contacts with optional names for easy identification
  - View ignored numbers (not in allow list) and add them when needed
- **Reliable Messaging**: Queue-based message sending with retry logic
- **TUI Integration**: Menu-driven interface for managing connections and contacts

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension:
```bash
pi install npm:whatsapp-pi
```

2. Start Pi (the extension will load automatically once installed):
```bash
pi
```

To automatically connect to WhatsApp on startup (if you are already authenticated):
```bash
pi -w
# or
pi --whatsapp
```

3. Use the menu to connect WhatsApp and manage allowed/blocked numbers

## Development / Testing

If you are developing or testing the extension locally:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the extension:
```bash
pi -e whatsapp-pi.ts
```

For verbose mode (shows Baileys trace logs for debugging):
```bash
pi -e whatsapp-pi.ts -v
# or
pi -e whatsapp-pi.ts --verbose
```

## Commands

- `/whatsapp` - Open the WhatsApp management menu
  - **Allow Numbers**: Manage contacts that can interact with Pi
  - **Blocked Numbers**: View ignored numbers (not in allow list) and add them to allow list
